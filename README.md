# CPP Unit Testing Practice

## Assessment summary

You are presented with 3 CS classes to be unit tested. Each class has its own complexity level:

- Easy: Simple class.
- Medium: Moderate class.
- Hard: Hard class.

## Suggested tested frameworks
The tests should be implemented using [MS Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest) framework,
as some of the units are from legacy code samples that are not easy to mock.
You MUST be familiar with MS Fakes as some of the dependencies can be mocked only using msfakes.

## Build Instructions

- Open the solution file in Microsoft Visual Studio
- Visual Studion might perfrom initial configuration on the first launch, in this case skip the sign in and accept default settings
- Please open the project in VisualStudio and rebuild the solution. Make sure it rebuilds without errors.
